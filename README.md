# PlayerPages

**PlayerPages** is a web application that generates and hosts minimalist, largely self-contained pages, which contain a mnenu, a media player with several options, and some optional branding.

It assumes that media is in H.264 / AAC, either in an MP4 container or as HLS, and is hosted on an external server (presumably a CDN).
It uses hls.js to provide HLS support on browsers with MSE.

PlayerPages is designed to make a media player as accessible as possible, for various users, devices, and use cases. The current goals for PlayerPages are:

1. Support for dedicated accessibility technologies, in particular:
    * screen readers (buttons should have labels, page should have regions, keep irrelevant noise to a minimum)
    * system light/dark colors
    * Windows high contrast mode
2. Support for older browsers and devices, such as:
    * iOS 6.1.6
        * Uses no-JavaScript fallback mode (media links are simple links to open a new tab)
    * TenFourFox with MP4 Enabler
        * Uses MSE (like modern browsers) but falls back to a simpler CSS (no summary tag support)
        * Autoplay is disabled and the user can select a quality level before pressing play (helps with slow decoding)
    * Wii U Internet Browser
        * Attempts media over HTTP if HTTPS fails to accomodate outdated certificate store
    * Internet Explorer 5+ with VLC ActiveX plugin
        * Conditional comments are used to replace media links with VLC embeds
        * All newer versions of IE (through 11) are forced into IE 5 rendering mode
3. Support for high-attendance scenarios
    * The pages generated by PlayerPages (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) can be served over a public CDN without any public traffic going back to the web server
    * PlayerPages should allow an external app to add/edit/delete a page, and invalidate the CDN when this happens
    * PlayerPages should allow an external app to privately fetch a page that may be hidden from the public and proxy it to its own user(s)

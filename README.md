# PlayerPages

**PlayerPages** is a web application that generates and hosts minimalist, largely self-contained pages, which contain a mnenu, a media player with several options, and some optional branding.

PlayerPages is designed to make a media player as accessible as possible, for various users, devices, and use cases. The current goals for PlayerPages are:

1. Support for dedicated accessibility technologies, in particular:
    * the NVDA screen reader
    * system light/dark colors
    * Windows high contrast mode
2. Support for old or unusual browsers and devices, in particular:
    * iOS 6
    * TenFourFox with MP4 Enabler
    * Wii U Internet Browser (and its outdated certificate store)
    * Internet Explorer 5+ with VLC ActiveX plugin
    * Google Cast
    * AirPlay
3. Support for high-attendance scenarios
    * All content generated by PlayerPages (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) should be able to be served over a public CDN without any public traffic going back to the web server
